EV Behavioral-Salary Segmentation

Project Overview

This project explores how behavioral traits and salary data can be used to segment potential customers for electric vehicles (EVs) in India. It combines clustering, data visualization, and manufacturer frequency analysis to define optimal target profiles for EV adoption.

The aim is to support EV companies, marketers, and policymakers in making data-driven decisions about product positioning, regional targeting, and campaign design.


Problem Statement

How can we identify ideal EV customers based on their behavioral patterns and salary, and where are they geographically concentrated?


Dataset

The dataset contains:

Demographic and behavioral features (e.g., risk appetite, sustainability concern, tech savviness)

Salary levels

EV brand preferences

Geographical regions (inferred or known)


Key Objectives

Cluster individuals based on behavioral and salary variables.

Analyze the frequency of different EV manufacturers.

Identify the Optimal Target Profile for EV adoption.

Map Geographical Target Regions for marketing and deployment.

Provide actionable insights for strategy and outreach.


Methodology

Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Distribution of behavioral traits

Salary vs brand preference trends

Clustering Analysis

Used KMeans (or Hierarchical Clustering) to form behavioral segments

EV Brand Frequency Analysis

Target Profile Identification

Behavioral

Salary-based

Geographic focus


Key Findings

Most EV makers occur only once, with minimal brand dominance.

Optimal customers are urban professionals with mid-to-high salaries, eco-conscious and tech-friendly.

Geographical targets include:

Tier-1 cities (e.g., Bangalore, Delhi, Pune)

Emerging Tier-2 towns

Commercial hubs for fleet sales

Rural areas for long-term, subsidy-driven potential


Tech Stack

Python (Jupyter Notebook)

pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn

scikit-learn (for clustering)

plotly (for interactive visualizations)
